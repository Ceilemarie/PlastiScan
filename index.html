 <section id="about">
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are Grade 12 STEM students from Bolbok Integrated National High School who developed the PLASTISCAN, 
      a solar-powered plastic bottle recycling vending machine with RFID card recognition. Our team aims to 
      combine technology and environmental responsibility by creating an automated system that encourages students
       to recycle plastic bottles inside the school campus. Through this project, we promote discipline, cleanliness, 
       and innovation while helping reduce plastic waste and protecting the environment.</p>
 </section>


<section id="goal">
    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>The goal of our project is to promote proper waste disposal and increase student participation 
      in recycling by making the process easy, interactive, and rewarding. Instead of throwing plastic 
      bottles anywhere, students are encouraged to recycle them using the machine and earn points.
       This helps the school maintain a cleaner environment, builds eco-friendly habits among students,
      and supports sustainable practices using modern technology and renewable solar energy.</p>

<section id="instructions">
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>To use PlastiScan, simply follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Student must first tap their RFID card on the scanner to register their identity. </li>
        <li>After the system recognizes the user, they can insert an empty plastic bottle into the bottle slot. </li>
        <li>The machine will automatically detect and count the bottle, then display the earned points on the screen. </li>
        <li>The app will identify the type of plastic and provide you with recycling instructions specific to that type.</li>
        <li>Once finished, the student can tap their card again to confirm and save their total points.</li>
        <li>The collected bottles are stored inside the machine for proper recycling.</li>
    </ol>
